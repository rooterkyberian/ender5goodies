Creality3d Ender 5 goodies

# Public Safety Announcement

Ender 5 (or other Creality3d/cheap printer) users should update their firmware so it implements Thermal Runaway Protection.
This software protection significantly lowers the fire hazard posed by normally well behaved 3d printer.

Original Ender 3 nor Ender 5 did have it. While Creality3d did publish updated firmware, I would suggest to go with the original Marlin software route. It is possible your newly bought printer already has it, but its better to double check it.
